Description: The TIN package implements a set of tools for
        transcriptome instability analysis based on exon expression
        profiles. Deviating exon usage is studied in the context of
        splicing factors to analyse to what degree transcriptome
        instability is correlated to splicing factor expression. In the
        transcriptome instability correlation analysis, the data is
        compared to both random permutations of alternative splicing
        scores and expression of random gene sets.
